						<p>Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organized. I've used a reset to insure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a bottom margin I make it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inline elements.</p>

						<p>ou can see that, even though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually rendered on the page. This may not be a huge deal in these first examples, but... </p>

						<p>What if I want my side-by-side elements to take up the full width of the parent element? I can set the width of each to 50%, right? </p>

					<div class="inlineblock fiftypercent">
						<p>Wrong! Because, together, the two inline block elements will add up to 100% of the available width, but that doesn't account for the space between. </p>

					<div class="floatbox fiftypercent">
						<p>The two elements are side-by-side just as I intended and fill the entire width of the parent (which, in this .se, is the same as the width of the viewport. </p>
